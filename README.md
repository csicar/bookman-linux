Bookman Cockpit Linux Edition
=============================

This is a small script that downloads the windows installer from their website, unpacks it, replaces the platform detection and start it up similar to how the `bookman.exe` would do on windows.

Dependencies
------------

Bookman's windows installer bundles these, but only for windows (obviously). This script expects them on the system.

For bookman:

* Java 17
* OpenJFX 17

For the script:

* curl
* unzip
